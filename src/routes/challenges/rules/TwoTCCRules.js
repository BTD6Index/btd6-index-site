        <h1>Rules for 2TCC</h1>
        <h2>Tower Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            Pairs of towers that already beat single-player 2TC do <strong>not</strong> count as 2TCC.
            Unlike single-player 2TC, Towers that have successfully soloed CHIMPS mode in the past or currently <strong>are</strong> allowed.
        </p>
        <h2>Challenge Settings</h2>
        <p>
            Must be done in a real co-op game (not challenge editor with extra starting cash).
            Alternate accounts of the same player are disallowed except to give co-op cash and then immediately leave.
            Using glitches to get extra cash per round is disallowed.
            The bug where you can disconnect for a round-ish and reconnect, all while letting your partner micro 1 tower without lag, is disallowed.
        </p>
        <h2>Submission Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            Victory Screen screenshots alone are insufficient for inclusion in The Index. You must also provide a screenshot of the final tower setup.
        </p>
        <h2>Hard Round Recordings</h2>
        <p>
            For the successful completion of a submission, recordings of gameplay during hard rounds are mandatory. If a helper from the community requests recordings of a particular round, you will have 48 hours to provide the requested footage. Failure to do so within this timeframe may result in a temporary suspension or ban from future submissions.
            Additionally, any runs featuring Adora must include full recordings of gameplay.
        </p>
        <h2>Fair Play and Game Integrity</h2>
        <p>
            No game modification, hacking, or unauthorized software use allowed. This includes the use of speedhacks and any other alterations that deviate from the game's original mechanics and settings. Violation leads to disqualification and potential exclusion from future challenges.
        </p>
