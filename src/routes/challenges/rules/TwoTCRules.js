        <h1>Rules for 2TC</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Any tower that (in the past or currently) soloes CHIMPS entirely on its own is disallowed. At the time of writing, they are <strong>Sauda</strong> and <strong>Geraldo</strong>.</li>
            <li>Challenge editor should be set to hard difficulty and CHIMPS mode.
Default values for Starting Cash, Staring Lives, Max Lives, Start Round, and End Round are acceptable.
<strong>Under no circumstances should your end round be set to r101, r120, r140, or r300.</strong></li>
            <li>Least Cash condition set to "No Score Set" is required for any run being submitted (you can easily reset this after winning a run by clicking auto twice)</li>
            <li>Victory Screen submissions are not sufficient enough to go on The Index, please provide a screenshot of the final setup.</li>
            <li>A challenge code (restricted to the 2 towers used) is required.</li>
            <li>Any Adora run needs full recordings.</li>
            <li>Any hard rounds need to be recorded.</li>
        </ol>
    </>;
